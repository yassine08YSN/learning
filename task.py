#● Create a Boolean variable named x
from re import T


x = True
print(type(x))

#Create an integer variable named y
y = 56
print(type(y))

#Create a float variable named z
z = 43.75
print(type(z))

#Create a string variable names s
s = "Yassine"
print(type(s))

#Convert the int variable to float
t = 2008
print(float(t))

#Can we convert the str to int ?
#yeeeess!!!
#the proof:
j = "45645"
print(int(j))

#Create a list of numbers from 1 to 5
l = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5]
print(type(l))

#Create a tuple from 10 to 15
m = 10, 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 ; 15
print(type(m))

#Convert the list to tuple
k = [1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6]
print(tuple(k))

#Create a dict of 3 values
o = {1:"yassine" , 8:"chtoui", 9:"7amid"}
print(type(o))

#Can we use semi colon ; with python

#Nooo , some others language use semi colons , like :
#  c++ , java ...
# but python donsn't use it .

● Python is interpreted or compiled ?
● What is the differences between low level & high level
● What is the differences between = , ==
● What do we mean by using !=
● What is the operator precedence
● Create a variable x with value of 10
● Increase x value by 15 using assignment operators
● Divide the x value by 5 using assignment operators
● Multiply the x value by 10 using assignment operator
● Get module of x on 3 using assignment operators
● Using python print the module of 11 to 4
● Print the exponent of 2,3
● Divide 11 by 3 using python division
● Can we divide 11 by 3 and get an integer number ?
● Check if 10 is bigger than 15 or not
● If 10 is not bigger than15 print x is smaller than 15
● In which cases we will use all
● What is the differences between all , and
● What is the differences between any , or
● If we need all the conditions to be true we will use ….
● What is the differences between if , elif
● What is the differences between elif else
● Can we use more than one elif
● Can we use more than one else
● write s simple ternary operator
● in elif , python will check all the conditions no matter what ?
● in elif we use else for ... ?
● if we have this list [2,4,6,8,10] :
○ check to see if 4 in this list or not
○ check to see if 4 and 6 in this list on not
○ check to see if 3 or 6 in this list
○ check to see if 2 , 4 and 5 in this list
